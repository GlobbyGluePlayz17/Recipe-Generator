Furthermore, in the entire world, there is about 1.3 billion tons of food wasted per year. A number that will only increase unless preventative measures are taken.\n\nLook into peoplesâ€™ homes. Oftentimes, food is left in the fridge to slowly rot away, leaving leftover incomplete portions of food forgotten and eventually thrown away as waste.\n\nNow, with our Recipe Generator, users can simply input ingredients they currently have and Recipe Generator will output a recipe that consists of the given ingredients. This way, users are able to maximize ingredients in their fridge, minimize food waste, and also end up with a satisfying homemade meal.",
